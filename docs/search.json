    "text": "A brief overview of wildlife-vehicle collision prevention\nWildlife-vehicle collisions are a fairly well-known hazard when driving on highways with a close proximity to wildlife habitats. This is particularly clear when considering British Columbia’s abundant wildlife. According to BC’s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, approximately 5700 vehicle collisions with wild animals happen on their provincial highways every year, with the vast majority (75%) being with deer1. In truth, this number is probably underestimated, as many drivers will fail to report collisions that occur.\nThese collisions are a concern for a variety of reasons. Seriously injuring or killing wildlife through these collisions can have a harmful effect on the animal populations and negatively affects species diversity and abundance, worsening the already existing consequences of constructing highways through areas with large populations of wildlife2. Moreover, they can cause a great deal of damage to the people involved in the collision. Depending on the size of the animal and the vehicle involved, a collision can result anywhere from minor to fatal injuries to the occupants of the vehicle. There is also a signifcant economic cost from the aforementioned injuries as well as damage to vehicles and highway clean-up.\nThere are many proposed ways to mitigate these collision on highways, with a number of them being commonly used in practice. The most common is wildlife warning signs; however, while inexpensive, this relies on the ability of the driver to notice and then stop their vehicle in time rather than actually reducing the amount of wildlife crossing the road. In fact, it has been found that these signs only briefly reduce the speed of the vehicle, and that these signs alone are not sufficient in preventing collisions with wildlife3. When considering methods that actively prevent wildlife from going onto the highway, the most common solutions are wildlife exclusion fencing, overpasses, and underpasses. In this post, we will mainly be focusing on fencing and underpasses due to their relatively cheaper cost; overpasses can cost more than twice the amount of underpasses4.\nUnderpasses allow wildlife to cross the highway by going beneath it. They can be a variety of different sizes, with evidence suggesting that different species prefer different types of underpasses5. Meanwhile, wildlife exclusion fencing around highways prevents animals from crossing the road where they otherwise might. They are often used in tandem with the under/overpasses so that wildlife is able to follow the fencing to the nearest safe crossing.\nIn efforts to reduce the number of wildlife-vehicle collisions, BC’s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure’s Wildlife Program has constructed over 500 km of wildlife exclusion fencing, 4 wildlife overpasses, 29 large wildlife underpasses, and more than 70 small underpasses, with these wildlife exlusion systems costing upwards of $750,000 per kilometre to build. This leads to an important question; how effective are these systems at preventing collisions?\n\n\nStudying the effects\nMany studies have been performed to evaluate the effectiveness of wildlife exclusion fencing and passageways. However, they have a number of limitations:\n\nMost studies focus on only large mammals, or a specific species (usually deer).\nVery few studies obtained wildlife use data before the construction of the prevention measures.\nThere have been no intensive studies of differences in wildlife mortality frequencies along segments of highways with and without prevention measures.\n\nMcCollister and Van Manen attempts to provide an answer to these limitations in their paper, Effectiveness of Wildlife Underpasses and Fencing to Reduce Wildlife-Vehicle Collisions6. This study, which was focused on a new section of United States Highway 64 in Washington County, North Carolina, USA, allowed the researchers to examine wildlife traffic through the area both before and after the construction of the highway. The section was in a forested area with limited human development and unpaved roads, and the new highway was planned to have 3 underpasses, as well as fencing on certain stretches. In this study, the authors used a combination of actively triggered camera systems and animal track surveys to track wildlife traffic through the area, particularly for the underpasses. Once the highway was constructed, they also collected data on wildlife-vehicle collision mortality by monitoring the highway for animal carcasses for 13 months. In order to standardize the number of wildlife mortality along different segments of the highway, they chose to use the frequency of mortalities per segment of the highway in their analyses.\nThe main model used in the analysis was a mixed-model analysis of variance; that is, a model used to group averages while accounting for natural differences between grouping factors (in this case, the different types of segments of the highway). In the study, they considered three main segments: underpasses, fenced areas, and areas without fencing. The model also took into account various features of the surrounding wildlife habitat that could potentially affect where wildlife is more willing to cross:\n\nThe percentage of forest cover surrounding the segment of the highway.\nThe presence or absence of forest cover on both sides of the highway.\nThe presence of absence of a distinct forest-agriculture edge; that is, whether the forest is bordering any farmland.\n\n\n\nWhat McCollister and Van Manen found\nThroughout the study, McCollister and Van Manen recorded 242 photographs of only white-tailed deer at proposed underpass sites before construction began, then 2,433 photographs of 9 different wildlife species after the construction of the underpasses were completed, suggesting that the underpasses and fencing were successful in funneling wildlife traffic through them. In addition, they observed a total of 128 animal mortalities in the 13 months they were monitoring the highway.\nThrough the mixed-model analysis of variance, for which all assumptions were met, the authors were able to come to several conclusions regarding the frequency of wildlife mortality across different segments of highway:\nIt was found that there was a higher wildlife mortality frequency for segments of highway with a forest-agriculture edge, likely due to the presence of agricultural crops. This is supported by the observed use of the underpasses; deer, the main species for which agricultural crops are of interest, most frequently used the central underpass, which was located closely to agricultural land. They also found that wildlife mortality frequency was higher for segments of highway with forest on both sides, likely since it gives wildlife for security, making them more likely to cross.\nWhen considering underpass, fenced, and unfenced sections of the highway, the study found that underpass sections had fewer mortalities than fenced, but had no apparent difference in frequency of mortalities when compared to unfenced. It was also found that the frequency of mortalities increases with the distance from the nearest underpass. While somewhat unintuitive, fenced segments were hypothesized to have similar mortality rates to unfenced segments due to animals following the fencing, then being struck after crossing where the fencing ends. Additionally, animals with smaller home ranges such as oppossums and raccoons are less likely to travel to the nearest underpass and may climb over the fence. For this reason, the inclusion of more frequent, smaller underpasses could be helpful when addressing smaller species.\nOverall, the authors observed that there was a lower ratio of deer mortality to the deer crossing count observed in the camera surveys, suggesting that only a small proportion of deer crossing the highway were fatally struck by vehicles. This is supported by an ad-hoc analysis the authors performed; when comparing deer mortality between the highway section in the study and surrounding stretches without underpasses, theuy found that the surrounding highway sections had 2.1 and 2.7 times more frequent collisions respectively. The paper claims that deer-vehicle collisions were reduced by as much as 58%. However, it is worth noting that bears were observed to cross in non-underpass locations, suggesting that the effectiveness varies by species.\n\n\nSo, are underpasses and fencing worth it?\nThe short answer is yes; there is a clear reduction in the number of collisions when concerning deer, which make up the vast majority of wildlife-vehicle collisions on highways. However, underpass and fencing placement is important, with certain species preferring different areas. Moreover, fencing should be as long as possible so that wildlife does not end up crossing the highway in areas where the fencing ends without any underpasses.\nOne final thing to consider is the other research suggests that the use of underpasses is a learned behaviour and may improve over time; for this reason, it may make sense to assess the effectiveness of these measures over a longer term.\n\n\nReferences\n[1] https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-guidelines/environmental-management/wildlife-management\n[2] https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40823-017-0020-6\n[3] https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0301479725040836\n[4] https://www.opb.org/article/2022/08/31/animal-crossings-over-and-under-highways-can-save-big-dollars-not-just-lives-says-new-study/\n[5] https://www.researchgate.net/publication/237510077_WILDLIFE_CROSSING_DESIGNS_AND_USE_BY_FLORIDA_PANTHERS_AND_OTHER_WILDLIFE_IN_SOUTHWEST_FLORIDA\n[6] https://wildlife.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.2193/2009-535"
