This is particularly clear when considering British Columbia’s abundant wildlife. According to BC’s Ministry of Transportation and Infrastructure, approximately 5700 vehicle collisions with wild animals happen on their provincial highways every year, with the vast majority (75%) being with deer1. In truth, this number is probably underestimated, as many drivers will fail to report collisions that occur.\nThese collisions are a concern for a variety of reasons. Seriously injuring or killing wildlife through these collisions can have a harmful effect on the animal populations and negatively affects species diversity and abundance, worsening the already existing consequences of constructing highways through areas with large populations of wildlife2. Moreover, they can cause a great deal of damage to the people involved in the collision. Depending on the size of the animal and the vehicle involved, a collision can result anywhere from minor to fatal injuries to the occupants of the vehicle. There is also a signifcant economic cost from the aforementioned injuries as well as damage to vehicles and highway clean-up.\nThere are many proposed ways to mitigate these collision on highways, with a number of them being commonly used in practice. The most common is wildlife warning signs; however, while inexpensive, this relies on the ability of the driver to notice and then stop their vehicle in time rather than actually reducing the amount of wildlife crossing the road. In fact, it has been found that these signs only briefly reduce the speed of the vehicle, and that these signs alone are not sufficient in preventing collisions with wildlife3. When considering methods that actively prevent wildlife from going onto the highway, the most common solutions are wildlife exclusion fencing, overpasses, and underpasses. In this post, we will mainly be focusing on fencing and underpasses due to their relatively cheaper cost; overpasses can cost more than twice the amount of underpasses4.\nUnderpasses allow wildlife to cross the highway by going beneath it. They can be a variety of different sizes, with evidence suggesting that different species prefer different types of underpasses5. Meanwhile, wildlife exclusion fencing around highways prevents animals from crossing the road where they otherwise might. They are often used in tandem with the under/overpasses so that wildlife is able to follow the fencing to the nearest safe crossing.\nlack of benchmarks (pre-road, pre-mitigation, or control data)\n[1] https://www2.gov.bc.ca/gov/content/transportation/transportation-infrastructure/engineering-standards-guidelines/environmental-management/wildlife-management\n[2] Bennett, V.
